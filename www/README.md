## IOS and Android
You have to instal Xcodes or the ADK to run the application

## Webstorm
The app was made on the webstorm ide, you have to open this project as PhoneGap / Cordova Application

## Running
Go to Run menu and select Run, wait for the emulator or simulator to open.


### With the Ionic tool:

Then, to run it, cd into `ioncurrency` and run:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac, but if you can, the ios development toolchain is a lot easier to work with until you need to do anything custom to Android.
